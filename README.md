# Estimating Revenue with in-app User Events

This pipeline calculates the LTV (life-time value) value of a mobile application user by analyzing the in-app events within the first 3 days after registration. LTV value has been estimated with regression. In addition, by applying binning, it was turned into a classification problem and classification success was evaluated.
